  + Find a game that I would like to play based on my interests or one which is randomly generated for me with no information collected.
  + Have an easy to use form which would allow me to enter information to aid in game selection.
  + Be given clear and easy to follow instructions which allow me to obtain the desired results with little effort.
  + Have a visually appealing and fun to use app interface which is engaging and seamlessly functional.
  + View my results in an organized manner with summary information about each game, and why it was returned (based on my input).
  + The ability to learn more about the people who created the app.
  + Having an easy and clear way to navigate between pages.

* As a Developer I want to:
  + Produce an app which engages the user and creates a fun way to get results and enter their data.
  + Collect User preferences through utilization of multiple form-fields to include drop-down menus. This will allow for very specific variables and less error in returning results.
  + Store data of games which is concise and provides a summary of each game.
  + Have the data structured in a way that makes it easy to retrieve and display to the User.
  + Provide User feedback about the generated selection(s) and how it relates to the information provided by the form data.
  + Check User's local storage to populate different options for new or return users based on previously entered data or no data shown.
  + Give the new User options to enter their information into a form to generate games based on their personal interests/preferences, or elect to enter nothing and immediately have a randomly generated game chosen for them.
  + Give the returning User the option to edit their closet or get a random game from the home page based on their previously entered information.
